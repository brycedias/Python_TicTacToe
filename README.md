# Python TicTacToe

This is just a simple application to refresh myself with python syntax and creating objects in python. It features a dynamic board size if you are feeling adventurous and want to venture outside of the classic 3x3 board.

There is an option to play vs the computer. I just used basic strategy in order to 
implement this feature. As it stands, the user will always be player 1 and the 
computer will always be player 2. Becuase of this, if played perfectly, player 1
will always be able to win. This is achieved by playing:
1. 0a
2. 2c
3. 2a

There is simply nothing the computer (or, anyone for that matter) can do about 
blocking that move.
